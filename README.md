# Treadmill Buyer Profile

This data project has been used as a take-home assignment in the recruitment process for the data science positions at Aerofit.

## Assignment - Beginner SQL Portion

The goal of this project is to be self-serving, and think from the perspective of a Data Analyst / Scientist. Instead of giving you scenarios that do no more than help you memorize syntax, think of questions the Manager of Marketing may be asking you. It can be as easy or complex as you want it to be.

Import this .csv into a SQL database of your choosing.

A few ideas to get the ball rolling:
- Average Age of customer per treadmill type.
- What fitness level is associated with each treadmille type?

## Assignment - Data Science Portion

The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

1. Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
2. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

## Product Portfolio:

    The KP281 is an entry-level treadmill that sells for $1,500;
    The KP481 is for mid-level runners and sells for $1,750;
    The KP781 treadmill is having advanced features and it sells for $2,500.

## Data Description

The company collected data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from the AeroFit stores during the prior three months. The dataset in aerofit_treadmill_data.csv has the following features:

    Product - product purchased: KP281, KP481, or KP781
    Age - in years
    Gender - male/female
    Education - in years
    MaritalStatus - single or partnered
    Usage - the average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week
    Fitness - self-rated fitness on a 1-5 scale, where 1 is the poor shape and 5 is the excellent shape
    Income - annual income in US dollars
    Miles - the average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week

## Practicalities

Analyze the provided data and provide insights to the best of your abilities. Include the relevant tables/graphs/visualization to explain what you have learned about the market. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process including the preparation of data - it is more important how the code is structured rather than just the final result or plot.
